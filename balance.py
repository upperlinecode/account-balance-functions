# 1. Create a notification method called getBalance() that takes an input of the balance and returns a message to the user. 
# Then call the function with two different balance values to ensure that it works properly.



# 2. Create a deposit method called makeDeposit() that takes two inputs - the current balance and the deposit amount and returns the resulting account balance.
# Call this function with two different deposits. 



# 3. Update your makeDeposit() method using your getBalance() method so it returns a message instead of just a number.



# 4. Create a makeWithdrawal() method that takes two inputs - the current balance and the withdrawal amount and returns the resulting account balance.



# 5. Update your makeWithdrawal() method using your getBalance() method so it returns a message instead of just a number.



# 6. Create a method overdraft() that takes an account balance as an input and returns a notice to a user if their account is overdrawn (negative).



# 7. Include the overdraft() method in your makeWithdrawal() method so makeWithdrawal() returns a message if the result of the withdrawal is a negative account balance.



# 8. Modify your overdraft() method to indicate to a user by how much their account is overdrawn.



# 9. Some banks charge a fee whenever a user overdraws their account. Update your makeWithdrawal() method to assess a $25 fee whenever an account is overdrawn.
